The game starts with a small introductory paragraph, the character is a 
sword for hire/detective. Hired by the king your initial quest is to destroy a 
necromancer. Although, when you destroy the necromancer, all of the Creation and Res 
magic it held in it's body is released in to the environment. personifying objects of minor 
inconvenience and summon ancient creatures and gods.
The King will ask you to slay <Certain enemies> on different floors and will meet you at a certain exit
blocking progression to the next floor unless you have certain items he can turn in to a potion
dropped by certain enemies on various floors.
As you progress you will come across requests to kill a fire drake that are making residents
flee the tower or they need the blood of a chaos angel to keep demons at bay.

	sacrifice using you as a catalyst to ressurect ancient creatures of formidable power 
	and bringing to life the remnants of the tower."

*You nod, grimacing in pain*

King: 	"So my eyes weren't decieved, it seems this situation has took a turn for the worse, 
	it happened in a flash, but , it couldn't have been anything else! Demon's seemingly 
	out of nowhere took my son. Please get him back, and show those Demon's that my 
	Son is not a trophy."

Throughout the floors you encounter an array of enemies of increasing difficulties there is 
35% chance of encounter from the first floor steadily creeping higher reaching 65% on MB1.

The movement consists of a north, east, south and west navigation where the player will 
move from room to room, encountering dead ends, each room will have an initial perception 
checks but somethings might be more than they seem from first glance, giving you the 
oppurtunity to have minor perception checks when you enter a new zone/room.

There are 4 main bosses, 3 demi bosses and 1 event boss.

Multiple choice questions - Revolved around an item on a different floor.
The door to the next stage could be blocked by a character giving you directions to slay a demi boss 
as he needs the item for one reason or another
