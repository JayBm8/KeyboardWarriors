We realised that our main mechanic in game was going to be the battle system, being in depth 
with the sort of attacks you can use. There will be a command you can type in to get the merchant 
up on demand with //Merchant in the terminal(Outide of battle). you can buy or sell the spoils 
you get from battles or chests, these can increase all your chances of surviving, for instance
if you want to play hardcore mode you can sell the check point amulets to the merchants for
a boost in funds early on in the game although, this can be done 3 times you get 3 amulets each 
increasing in value, because each amulet is increasingly harder to aquire than the last 
and there is a higher possibility of death after each checkpoint as the encounter rate for random 
battles increases and the creatures become stronger the further you progress.

The Movement Mechanic is going to be a north, west, south and east room movement feature
You will have an initial perception on top of the chance to have a greater perception, although
greater perception is usually user for rooms that are greater sizes than the standard let's say
this is the size of a standard room: 
 _                          __                  ____
[_] = Standard    [__] = double [____] = triple

Let's imagine you enter the 1st part of a triple room, you can use greater perception to look at 
the the next two parts ahead. Doing this could be the difference between preparing for a huge 
battle, and dying mercilessly because of it.
