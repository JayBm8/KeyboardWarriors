Some items are going to have an exclusive variable under the name of minor action. 
Minor Actions are going to be one time use per turn. this does not take up your main 
attack phase within the battle, this gives you the opportunity to take advantage of 
temporary stat increasing items without the drawback of losing the attack phase of 
your turn whilst using the increased buff to take you further in to a battle.

Attacking is an instant turn ender, any skills or spells that effect the opponent count
as a major action.
	 the only minor action that effects the enemy are stat debuff moves that can be 
used once per turn (like any other minor action) before attacking said enemy.
Status moves count as major acions (Ie: poison, stun, burn)
